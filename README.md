# AI NLP Architect
The Intel® AI NLP Architect is a repository for models exploring the state of the
art deep learning techniques for natural language processing. It is intended
to be a space to promote research and collaboration.

Because of its exploratory nature, several open source deep learning frameworks are used in this repository including:

* [Intel® Nervana™ graph](https://github.com/nervanasystems/neon)
* [Intel® neon](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph-python)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Dynet](https://dynet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Each of the models includes algorithm descriptions, installation
requirements, and results. Overtime the list of models included in this space will grow.
The library is separated into core module components, models, and solutions.
Each of the modules, models, and solution contains its own set of python requirements,
though all generally run with Python 3.5+.

## Documentation
Framework documentation, algorithm description and instructions on how to contribute a new agent/environment can be found here.

## Installation
Please see the individual modules, models, and solutions for installation instructions.
An overall installation process will be coming soon.

## Disclaimer
The NLP Architect is released as a reference code for research purposes. It is not an official Intel product, and the level of quality and support may not be as expected from an official product. Additional algorithms and environments are planned to be added to the framework. Feedback and contributions from the open source and NLP research communities are more than welcome.
