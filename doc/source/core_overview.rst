Core Library Modules
#####################

Overview
========

The IntelÂ® NLP AI-lab core consists of a set of NLP libraries that can be used
as building blocks for language understanding. These libraries are built with
modularity in mind, so that they can be utilized much like you would used
spacy_ or nltk_.

When completed, these libraries will be part of the NLP Services Server as imaged below.

The current core modules are:

* :doc:`NP2Vec`<np2vec>`: word embedding's model training for Noun Phrases
* :doc:`Chunker <chunker>`: syntactical part of speech tagging
* :doc:`Intent <intent>`: extraction of the intended action from text
* :doc:`Noun-phrase Segmentation <np_segmentation>`: parsing nouns and phrases
* :doc:`NER Expansion <ne_expansion>`: a domain agnostic semi-supervised algorithm for named entity set expansion
* :doc:`Most Common Word Sense <word_sense>`: determination of the most probable meaning of a word

Each of these modules are described in depth in the next sections
