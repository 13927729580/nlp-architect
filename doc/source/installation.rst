Installation
############

Requirements
============

The IntelÂ® NLP Architect requires **Python 3.5+** running on a
Linux* or UNIX-based OS (like Mac OS). We recommend using the library with Ubuntu 16.04+.

Before installing the library make sure you has the most recent packages listed below:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Ubuntu* 16.04+ or CentOS* 7.4+", "Mac OS X*", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 20, 42
   :escape: ~

   python 3.6, python 3.6, Python 3.6 (preferred)
   python-pip, pip, Tool to install Python dependencies
   python-virtualenv (*), virtualenv (*), Allows creation of isolated environments ((*): This is required only for Python 2.7 installs. With Python3: test for presence of ``venv`` with ``python3 -m venv -h``)
   libhdf5-dev, h5py, Enables loading of hdf5 formats
   pkg-config, pkg-config, Retrieves information about installed libraries

.. note::
  The default installations of models use the default CPU backend deep learning framework installations.

Instructions
============

We recommend installing NLP Architect within a virtual environment to ensure a self-contained environment. To install NLP Architect models within an already existing virtual environment, see below installation receipes for custom model installation. The default installation will create a new local virtual environment for development purposes.

To get started using our library, clone our repository:

.. code:: python

  git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ai-lab-nlp.git
  cd ai-lab-nlp

Models and NLP/NLU components are installed individualy (preferred way) or all at once (installed all deep learning frameworks and dependencies).
