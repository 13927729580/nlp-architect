Installation
############

Requirements
============

The IntelÂ® NLP Architect requires **Python 3.5+** running on a
Linux* or UNIX-based OS.
Each model contains its own installation requirements, but in general,
before installing, ensure your system has recent updates of the following packages:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Ubuntu* 16.04+ or CentOS* 7.4+", "Mac OS X*", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 20, 42
   :escape: ~

   python-pip, pip, Tool to install Python dependencies
   python-virtualenv (*), virtualenv (*), Allows creation of isolated environments ((*): This is required only for Python 2.7 installs. With Python3: test for presence of ``venv`` with ``python3 -m venv -h``)
   libhdf5-dev, h5py, Enables loading of hdf5 formats
   pkg-config, pkg-config, Retrieves information about installed libraries

.. note::
  The default installations of models use the default CPU backend installations. In order to use GPU/MKL backends the user must install it himself.

Instructions
============

We recommend installing NLP Architect within a virtual environment to ensure a self-contained environment. To install NLP Architect models within an already existing virtual environment, see below installation receipes for custom model installation. The default installation will create a new local virtual environment for development purposes.

To get started using our library, run the following commands:

.. code:: python

  git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ai-lab-nlp.git
  cd ai-lab-nlp; make setup_env
