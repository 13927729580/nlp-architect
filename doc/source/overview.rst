:Date: |today|

The Intel® AI NLP Architect is a repository for models exploring the state of the
art deep learning techniques for natural language processing. It is intended
to be a space to promote research and collaboration.

Because of its exploratory nature, several open source deep learning frameworks are used in this repository including:

- `Intel® Nervana™ graph`_
- Intel® neon_
- Tensorflow_
- Keras_
- Dynet_


Each of the models includes algorithm descriptions, installation
requirements, and results. Overtime the list of models included in this space
will grow. The library is separated into core module components, models, and solutions.
Each of the modules, models, and solution contains its own set of python requirements,
though all generally run with Python 3.5+. For further installation information, please see
the :doc:`installation <installation>` page.

We welcome collaboration, suggestions, and critiques. For information on how to become a developer
on this project, please see the :doc:`developer guide <developer_guide>`.
